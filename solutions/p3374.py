# Problem
"""

Write a solution to transform the text in the content_text column by applying the following rules:

Convert the first letter of each word to uppercase and the remaining letters to lowercase
Special handling for words containing special characters:
For words connected with a hyphen -, both parts should be capitalized (e.g., top-rated → Top-Rated)
All other formatting and spacing should remain unchanged
Return the result table that includes both the original content_text and the modified text following the above rules.

The result format is in the following example.



Example:

Input:

user_content table:

+------------+---------------------------------+
| content_id | content_text                    |
+------------+---------------------------------+
| 1          | hello world of SQL              |
| 2          | the QUICK-brown fox             |
| 3          | modern-day DATA science         |
| 4          | web-based FRONT-end development |
+------------+---------------------------------+
Output:

+------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| content_id | original_text                   | converted_text                  |
+------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| 1          | hello world of SQL              | Hello World Of Sql              |
| 2          | the QUICK-brown fox             | The Quick-Brown Fox             |
| 3          | modern-day DATA science         | Modern-Day Data Science         |
| 4          | web-based FRONT-end development | Web-Based Front-End Development |
+------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
Explanation:

For content_id = 1:
Each word's first letter is capitalized: "Hello World Of Sql"
For content_id = 2:
Contains the hyphenated word "QUICK-brown" which becomes "Quick-Brown"
Other words follow normal capitalization rules
For content_id = 3:
Hyphenated word "modern-day" becomes "Modern-Day"
"DATA" is converted to "Data"
For content_id = 4:
Contains two hyphenated words: "web-based" → "Web-Based"
And "FRONT-end" → "Front-End"


Constraints:

context_text contains only English letters, and the characters in the list ['\', ' ', '@', '-', '/', '^', ',']
